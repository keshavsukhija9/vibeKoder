# VibeCoder – Local-AI Integrated Development Environment

![VibeCoder Thumbnail](public/vibe-code-editor-thumbnaail.svg)

**VibeCoder** is a browser-native IDE that fuses local code execution with on-device Large Language Model (LLM) assistance. Built as a privacy-first, high-performance alternative to cloud-dependent AI coding tools, it runs entirely in the browser using **StackBlitz WebContainers**, **Monaco Editor**, and **local LLMs (Ollama)**. The roadmap includes **LanceDB** for codebase-aware RAG and **AST-based code intelligence** — see the [PRD](docs/PRD-VibeCoder.md) for full scope.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibecode-editor.git
cd vibecode-editor
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file using the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, set a JWT secret for auth (optional for dev; required for production):

```env
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-at-least-32-chars-long
```

The app uses **SQLite** for all data (users, playgrounds, template files, star marks). The database file is created automatically at `.vibecoder/vibecoder.db` (or set `DATABASE_PATH`).

### 4. Models (Ollama) — required for AI features

The app **does use models**: all AI features (code completion, RAG indexing) call **Ollama** on your machine. If AI seems to do nothing, it’s usually because Ollama isn’t running or the models aren’t pulled.

| Feature | Model | Env variable | Default |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Code completion (Ctrl+Space, etc.) | LLM | `VIBECODER_LLM_MODEL` | `codellama:latest` |
| RAG / “Index codebase for AI” | Embedding | `VIBECODER_EMBED_MODEL` | `nomic-embed-text` |

**One-time setup:** Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), then pull and run the models:

```bash
# Code completion (required for in-editor AI)
ollama pull codellama

# RAG / codebase indexing (optional)
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Keep Ollama running (e.g. `ollama run codellama` or the Ollama app). To use different models, set in `.env`:

```env
VIBECODER_LLM_MODEL=your-model:tag
VIBECODER_EMBED_MODEL=your-embed-model
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### 6. Use the app

- **No sign-in:** Click **Try the editor** on the home page → you get a demo React project. Edit, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the terminal, use the preview panel. Sign in to save projects.
- **With sign-in:** Go to **Dashboard** → **Add New** → pick a template → open the playground. Save with Ctrl+S.
- **AI:** Run `ollama run codellama`, then in the editor use **Ctrl+Space** or **Double Enter** for suggestions; **Tab** to accept.

See **[How to use](docs/HOW-TO-USE.md)** for a full walkthrough.
